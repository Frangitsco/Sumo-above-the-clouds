# Sumo-above-the-clouds
Unity Project
Arcade-style Sumo battle with the objective of knocking increasingly difficult waves of enemies off of a floating island, using power ups to help defeat them. 
Player movement is governed by a 'Focal Point' that is aligned with the camera's orientation. When the player rotates the camera left or right, the 'Focal Point' moves accordingly, setting the direction for the player's forward and backward movement. This means the player moves in the direction the camera is facing when they press the forward or backward movement keys.
